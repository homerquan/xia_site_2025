I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I direct the [**Mobile X Lab**](). Before joining Columbia, I was the co-director of the [Dartmouth Networking and Ubiquitous Systems (DartNets) Lab](http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/) and the [Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab (RLab)](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College. I was also  affiliated with the [Augmented Health Lab](https://www.ah-lab.cs.dartmouth.edu/). I received my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) in June, 2013, working under the supervision of [Prof. Heather Zheng](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/). I was a visiting faculty in [National Taiwan University](http://www.eecs.ntu.edu.tw) from December 2016 to February 2017, and in [University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) from April 2017 to June 2017.

My research interest lies broadly in mobile computing and its intersection with other disciplines. Most of my current projects center on light - a ubiquitous medium around us. We explore a range of projects that turn light into a powerful medium for data communication and object/behavioral sensing. Check out our [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhj_t5VL-SnOAj24EJcwaw/videos) to learn more details. My PhD work designed network systems to handle the massive volume and unpredictable nature of today's data traffic (see more in our [MobiCom'08](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xia/papers/mobicom08_veritas.pdf) and [SIGCOMM'12](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xia/papers/sigcomm12_beam3d.pdf) papers).

I am fortunate to work with a group of talented and motivated students at the Mobile X Lab. I am also looking for motivated students to join us! If you are interested in mobile systems research, please email me with your CV. Before you apply, please take a look at [this website](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/phd/) to know more about the Columbia PhD program.
