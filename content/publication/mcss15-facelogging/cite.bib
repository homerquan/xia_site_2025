abstract = {We discuss the opportunistic face logging project that collected 5811 opportunistic photos using the front-facing camera from the smartphones of 37 participants over a 10-week period. We present our experiences using computer vision and human labeling approaches on the photos to assess mental health of the participants. Finally, we discuss our insights, challenges, and future directions.},
