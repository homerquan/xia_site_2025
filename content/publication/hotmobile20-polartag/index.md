abstract: "Visual tags (e.g.,barcodes, QR codes) are ubiquitous in modern day life, though they rely on obtrusive geometric patterns to encode data, degrading the overall user experience. We propose a new paradigm of passive visual tags which utilizes light polarization to imperceptibly encode data using cheap, widely-available components. The tag and its data can be extracted from background scenery using off-the-shelf cameras with inexpensive LCD shutters attached atop camera lenses. We examine the feasibility of this design with real-world experiments. Initial results show zero bit errors at distances up to 3.0~m, an angular-detection range of 110'', and robustness to manifold ambient light and occlusion scenarios."
