abstract = {We examine the feasibility of human identification using purely the ubiquitous visible light. Empowered by the Visible Light Communication (VLC), the identification system consists of VLC-enabled LED lights on the ceiling emitting light beacons, and photodiodes on the floor capturing a continuous stream of shadow maps each corresponding to an LED light. We leverage these shadow maps to localize a user's key boy joints in the 3D space and recognize the user based on the estimated body parameters (e.g., shoulder width, arm length). Preliminary results with 10 participants show 80% success rate, i.e., correctly identifying 8 participants out of 10. The mean error of the body parameter estimation is 0.03 m. To extend the system to diverse practical settings, we discuss the our plan of incorporating advanced behavioral features to enhance the identification accuracy and robustness.},
