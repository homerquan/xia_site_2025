abstract = {We describe our efforts to empirically validate a distributed spectrum monitoring system built on commodity smartphones and embedded low-cost spectrum sensors. This system enables real-time spectrum sensing, identifies and locates active transmitters, and generates alarm events when detecting anomalous transmitters. To evaluate the feasibility of such a platform, we perform detailed experiments using a prototype hardware platform using smartphones and RTL dongles. We identify multiple sources of error in the sensing results and the end-user overhead (i.e. smartphone energy draw). We propose and implement a variety of techniques to identify and overcome errors and uncertainty in the data, and to reduce energy consumption. Our work demonstrates the basic viability of user-driven spectrum monitoring on commodity devices.},
