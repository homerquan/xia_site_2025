abstract = {We propose for the first time an integrated Visible Light Communication (iVLC) system, which combines scalable VLC networking and accurate VLC sensing of mobile users. To meet this goal, we envision using modulated LED lights for communications between networked devices, while at the same time using the very same lights to accurately identify and track users, and importantly, sense and infer their gestures (e.g., pointing to an object in the room) as a means of collecting user analytics and enabling interactions with objects in smart spaces. Enabling the iVLC vision requires reliable VLC networking and robust VLC sensing. We discuss the key research components and open challenges in realizing this vision. By combining VLC networking and sensing, iVLC opens the way for a new class of context-aware applications and a new HCI paradigm not possible before.},
